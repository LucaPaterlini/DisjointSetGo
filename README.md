## Disjoint Set (rank)

### Quick message
I was reading the book Advanced Data structures [Advanced Data structures](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Advanced-Data-Structures-Peter-Brass/dp/0521880378)
that I have found really well done in the math and theorems part, but 
not really accurate on the code implementations.
For my personal knowledge i am studing and I have decided to implement
the union find becouse I have not found better implementations in Go.

If there are pls let me know I am happy to have a look at them.

Happy learning :)

N.B. this code is really not well commented and was quickly pushed during a discussion
N.B.2. as obvious the is no guarantees attached.
